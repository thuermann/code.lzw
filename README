This is a very simple file compressor und decompressor using the
Lempel-Zev-Welch (LZW) algorithm.  Compression rates are very similar
to those of the Unix program compress which uses the Lempel-Zev
algorithm.

This code was written for purely experimental purposes and to provide
very simple and clean code to show how compression works.
